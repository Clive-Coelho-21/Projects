# Distance Measurement Project

## Components Used:
1. Arduino Nano  
2. 16x2 Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) with I2C Module  
3. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor  
4. Buzzer  

## Software Used:
1. Arduino IDE

## Working

This project uses an Arduino Nano and an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance of nearby objects. The system continuously monitors the distance, and if an object comes closer than 10 cm, the buzzer sounds to provide an audible alert. When the distance remains above 10 cm, the buzzer stays off. Additionally, the real-time distance is displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen via the I2C module, providing clear visual feedback to the user.
